# StructOpt

###Style Guide:

* Spaces after commas and other general PEP 8 things

* All operators should have spaces around them unless there are multiple operators on the same line and you want to break up the line for better readability

* Functions have 2 newlines after them

* Classes have 3 newlines after them

* Uses spaces and not tabs (you can set your text editor to do this by default)

* In-line comment lines should have two spaces before the # symbol

* Above-line comment lines have have one space before the # symbol unless it's pure code, then no spaces

* Use .format rather than + or %s

* Separate different ideas by newlines in any code

* Put one newline after docstrings

* Use print(...) and *not* print ...

* Don't do 1-line if statements (or any other 1-line loops either); just make them 2 lines

* Use the full names of things rather than abbreviations if the difference is only a few letters

* Use `enumerate` not counters.
