# StructOpt

###Style Guide:

* Spaces after commas and other general PEP 8 things

* All operators should have spaces around them unless there are multiple operators on the same line and you want to break up the line for better readability

* Functions have 2 newlines after them

* Classes have 3 newlines after them

* Uses spaces and not tabs (you can set your text editor to do this by default)

* In-line comment lines should have two spaces before the # symbol

* Above-line comment lines have have one space before the # symbol unless it's pure code, then no spaces
